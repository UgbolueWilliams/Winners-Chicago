     		<p id="inner-first-time-worshiperp2">The youth ministry is movement to empower the next generation to follow God’s plan for their life. We understand Entering adulthood, starting a new job, going to college, and other major changes in life can often leave young adults with more questions than answers. However, we know that if we base our life, and the decisions we make on the solid foundation of of God's word; He God promises that our life will be great, and success is guaranteed! Psalm 1: 1-3 Therefore, this ministry is designed for our millennial generation, to offer opportunities to connect, and grow in the relationship with God, and others, thereby making their marks in life.</p>
